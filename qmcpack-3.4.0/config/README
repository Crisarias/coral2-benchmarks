Toolchains for systems not fully supported by the CMake build system
automatically. It is preferred to expand the capabilities of the
automatic system instead of adding custom machine specific
workarounds, but this may not be possible.

Old toolchains are stored in attic directory. These need to be updated
and simplified for the current build system. They may also give ideas
for what may be needed on specific systems.
