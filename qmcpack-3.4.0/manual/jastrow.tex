\section{Jastrow Factors}
\label{sec:jastrow}

Jastrow factors are among the simplest and most effective ways of including
dynamical correlation in the trial many body wavefunction.  The resulting many body
wavefunction is expressed as the product of an antisymmetric (in the case
of Fermions) or symmetric (for Bosons) part and a correlating jastrow factor
like so:
\begin{equation}
\Psi(\vec{R}) = \mathcal{A}(\vec{R}) \exp\left[J(\vec{R})\right]
\end{equation}

In this section we will detail the types and forms of Jastrow factor used 
in QMCPACK.  Note that each type of Jastrow factor needs to be specified using
its own individual jastrow XML element.  For this reason, we have repeated the
specification of the jastrow tag in each section, with specialization for the
options available for that given type of jastrow.

\subsection{One-body Jastrow functions}
\label{sec:onebodyjastrow}
The one-body Jastrow factor is a form that allows for the direct inclusion
of correlations between particles that are included in the wavefunction with
particles that are not explicitly part of it.  The most common example of
this are correlations between electrons and ions.  

The jastrow function is specified within a \texttt{wavefunction} element
and must contain one or more \texttt{correlation} elements specifying
additional parameters as well as the actual coefficients. Section
\ref{sec:1bjsplineexamples} gives examples of the typical nesting of
\texttt{jastrow}, \texttt{correlation}, and \texttt{coefficient} elements.

\subsubsection{Input Specification}

\begin{table}[h]
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{l c c c l }
\hline
\multicolumn{5}{l}{Jastrow element} \\
\hline
\bfseries name & \bfseries datatype & \bfseries values & \bfseries defaults  & \bfseries description \\
\hline
name & text &    & (required) & Unique name for this Jastrow function \\
type & text & One-body & (required) & Define a one-body function \\ 
function & text & Bspline & (required) & BSpline Jastrow \\
             & text & pade2 & & Pade form \\

  \hline

& Correlation & & & \\ \hline
\multicolumn{5}{l}{Contents}\\ \hline
& (None)  & & &  \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
%\end{tabular*}
\end{center}
\end{table}

To be more concrete, the one-body jastrow factors used to describe correlations
between electrons and ions take the form below
\begin{equation}
J1=\sum_I^{ion0}\sum_i^e u_{ab}(|r_i-R_I|)
\end{equation}
where I runs over all of the ions in the calculation, i runs over the electrons
and $u_{ab}$ describes the functional form of the correlation between them.
Many different forms of $u_{ab}$ are implemented in QMCPACK.  We will detail 
two of the most common ones below.

\subsection{Two-body Jastrow functions}
The two-body Jastrow factor is a form that allows for the explicit inclusion
of dynamic correlation between two particles included in the wavefunction.  It
is almost always given in a spin dependent form so as to satisfy the Kato cusp
condition between electrons of different spins\cite{kato}.

 The two body jastrow function is specified within a \texttt{wavefunction} element
and must contain one or more correlation elements specifying additional parameters
as well as the actual coefficients.  Section \ref{sec:2bjsplineexamples} gives 
examples of the typical nesting of \texttt{jastrow}, \texttt{correlation} and
\texttt{coefficient} elements.

\subsubsection{Input Specification}

\begin{table}[h]
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{l c c c l }
\hline
\multicolumn{5}{l}{Jastrow element} \\
\hline
\bfseries name & \bfseries datatype & \bfseries values & \bfseries defaults  & \bfseries description \\
\hline
name & text &    & (required) & Unique name for this Jastrow function \\
type & text & Two-body & (required) & Define a one-body function \\ 
function & text & Bspline & (required) & BSpline Jastrow \\
print & text & yes / no & yes & jastrow factor printed in external file?\\
  \hline
\multicolumn{5}{l}{elements}\\ \hline
& Correlation & & & \\ \hline
\multicolumn{5}{l}{Contents}\\ \hline
& (None)  & & &  \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
%\end{tabular*}
\end{center}
\end{table}

The two-body jastrow factors used to describe correlations between electrons take the form
\begin{equation}
J2=\sum_i^{e}\sum_{j>i}^{e} u_{ab}(|r_i-r_j|)
\end{equation}

The most commonly used form of two body jastrow factor supported by the code is a splined
jastrow factor, with many similarities to the one body spline jastrow.

\subsection{Three-body Jastrow functions}
Explicit three body correlations can be included in the wavefunction via the three-body
jastrow factor.
